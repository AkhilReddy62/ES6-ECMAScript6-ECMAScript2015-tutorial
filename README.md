JavaScript ES6-ECMAScript 6-ECMAScript 2015 Features for everyone
=====================
`ES6-ECMAScript 6-ECMAScript 2015` is the latest version of the specification for JavaScript. Here will meet the `future of JavaScript`: as JavaScript follows ECMAScript standards. This course takes a look at the latest features of ECMAScript 6 (aka ES6) and how these changes are making JavaScript even more powerful and concise. Will learn/review the `new keywords` and `function/object syntax` and shows how the new `class syntax` can be used with JavaScript library like Angular, React, Node. You'll also review the ES6 compiling tool `Babel`, and use Babel to make your ES6 code compatible with modern browsers.

### Prerequisites for current course / What you need to know
`ES6-ECMAScript 6-ECMAScript 2015` introduce us to the newest language features that can be used in JavaScript code. Due to this, I assume you have some working knowledge/understanding of JavaScript. If you haven't, will recommend watching [JavaScript Essentials Tutorial for beginners](https://github.com/dinanathsj29/javascript-beginners-tutorial). Also, some basic knowledge of HyperText Markup Language (HTML) [HTML5 Essentials](https://github.com/dinanathsj29/html5-essentials-tutorial) and [CSS3 Fundamentals](https://github.com/dinanathsj29/css3-fundamentals-tutorial) will likely be useful in your work with ES6. Finally, you will be using a bit of Angular.js, React.js and Node.js but nothing that requires deep/advanced knowledge.

Section 1. Course Introduction
=====================
### 1.1. Welcome
Hi All, I'm **`Dinanath Jayaswal, Senior UI/Web Developer and Adobe Certified Expert Professional`**, I wanna welcome you to `ES6-ECMAScript 6-ECMAScript 2015`. In this course/content will go over how to start with using ES6 features right with bang. Will dive into the specifics of ES6 and new features it includes. We'll look at new keywords and operators that can be used to simplify code structure. At the end we'll take a look at class syntax in ES6 and how that can be used immediately with very popular JavaScript library/frameworks like Angular, React. Let us explore and learn some pretty exciting stuff so let's go ahead and get started with `ES6-ECMAScript 6-ECMAScript 2015`.

`ES6-ECMAScript 6-ECMAScript 2015` will introduce us to the newest language features that can be used in JavaScript code. 

### 1.2. Who is this for?
